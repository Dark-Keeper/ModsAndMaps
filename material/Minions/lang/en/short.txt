Minions are yellow, small, cylindrical creatures which are most known for their appearance in the Minions movie. This addon adds them to Minecraft PE. They are very cute and can be used for multiple things. For example, you can tame them, have them fight for you or you can send them away on missions such as hunting or to go fishing.
