Portal 2 Mod (previously Portal Gun) adds many of the features as found in the popular first-person puzzle-platform Portal games to Minecraft Pocket Edition. The gameplay elements include features like the PortalGuns to place portals, a GravityGun which can be used for both blocks and mobs and lots of other nifty tools.
 
Guns 
The PortalGun Wood and Stone is used to place the portals. Two portals can be placed and used to walk through to get teleported from one point to another. It can be used 100 times.

The PortalGuns can be used to pick up blocks from the ground and move them to be placed somewhere else. There are four types of such guns: 
 
Portal Gun (3651) (bullet speed: 40 block/second, 1000 usage times) – 4 iron ingots  1 diamond 
Portal Gun Gold (3652) (bullet speed: 30 block/second, 500 usage times) – 4 iron ingots  1 diamond 
Portal Gun Iron (3653) (bullet speed: 20 block/second, 250 usage times) – 8 iron ingots 
Portal Gun Lava (3654) (bullet speed: 20 block/second, 200 usage times) – 4 iron ingots  1 flint and steel
 
The GravityGun can be used to pick up mobs and blocks from the ground and then bring them to the place where you want them placed. You can also choose to shoot them away. A bit more cruel, but fun!

Turrets 
Turrets are can be placed down and act as guards which protect from all intruders (even yourself). To manage the turret tap on it with the Turret Options item.

Portal Music 
There are three discs added which all can be used to play music from Portal 2 using a jukebox. 
 
If you feel more for some electronic music then try out the Portal Radio.

Jumper 
Jumper blocks can be placed on the ground and whenever you walk on top of a jumper you will be rocketed up into the air. 

 
Gel Blocks 
There are two types of gel blocks which will cause two different effects when walking or jumping on them. 
 
If you jump on the Repulsion Gel Block it will cause you to automatically jump four more times (lower and lower) until ultimately stopping you from jumping.
