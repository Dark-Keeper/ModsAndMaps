The Mine-Cars Add-on replaces five mobs in-game with five brand new cars. The vehicles are quite fast and offer a great opportunity to more easily move around in Minecraft. The vehicles are very good as they require no fuel. In that sense, it’s a car of the future.

How to drive a car?
First off you need to find a car. The easiest way is probably to spawn one in creative mode. There are five different cars and each of them replaces a mob in-game:

Red Car = Stray
Blue Car = Wither Skeleton
Green Car = Skeleton
Orange Car = Zombie Pigman
Yellow Car = Husk
There is no difference in terms of speed between the different cars.

iOS / Android: Long press on the car and press Drive to enter the vehicle
Windows 10: Right-click it to enter the car

To drive the vehicle you will need a key (carrot on a stick). Hold the key to drive the car. To stop the car simply unequip the key.

It’s a great way to get around in Minecraft and it’s like a modern alternative to riding horses.

And since it’s a cabriolet (open roof) you probably want to put on a helmet (chain helmet) to keep yourself safe from injuries.
