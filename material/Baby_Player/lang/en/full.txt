Baby Player is an addon which makes it possibility to become a baby (also known as a small person) in Minecraft Pocket Edition. The best thing is that it works for any custom skin. This is purely a visual mod as it doesn’t actually change any characteristics of the player (e.g. health or strength).

The player player is much smaller than the ordinary player model. It works perfectly fine for custom skins. The only downside which I found by using this mod was that any item you hold in your hand looks glitched. You can still use the item but visually it looks bad.

You’ll be slightly taller than a baby villager. Quite adorable, don’t you think? I know, his eyes look a bit spooky but whatever! If you want this baby skin you can get it by clicking here.

You could actually use this addon to turn into Ant-Man. Drink some strength and speed potions and you are soon just like him!

Baby Mobs

This download includes an optional addon which will turn all mobs in Minecraft into babies. Even ones like the creeper will look like babies.
