Zombie Apocalypse is an add-on which makes survival mode much more difficult. Hostile mobs such as zombies are both stronger and faster and they are no longer affected by the sunlight. This means that you can run into zombies any time during the day. Humans, villagers, animals – none of you are safe in this world. Watch out! Zombies are out there to eat you!
