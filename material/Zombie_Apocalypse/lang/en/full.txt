Zombie Apocalypse is an add-on which makes survival mode much more difficult. Hostile mobs such as zombies are both stronger and faster and they are no longer affected by the sunlight. This means that you can run into zombies any time during the day. Humans, villagers, animals – none of you are safe in this world. Watch out! Zombies are out there to eat you!

How does it work?
Anything alive is a target to zombies. This includes both players and animals such as pigs and chickens. Zombies are no longer affected by the sunlight and this means that they can grow into massive numbers quickly.

One time I found myself hiding in a tree top and when I eventually got down they quickly came after me.

Turn your survival world into a post-apocalyptic world. If you watch The Walking Dead then this addon is a must-have!
