Pixelmon PE is an advanced Pokémon mod for Minecraft Pocket Edition. Even though it’s currently released as a beta version it has loads of features and many of them work quite well. You can catch Pokémon, duel others and use items such as the Pokedex to view detailed information about your Pokémon. Even for the fact it’s still being in beta it definitely is very fun to use and is most definitely worth testing out!
