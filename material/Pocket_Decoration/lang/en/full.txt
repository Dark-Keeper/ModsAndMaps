The PocketDecoration Mod adds 34 furniture and 16 colored stained glass blocks. Some of the decorations include a doorbell, plenty of kitchen furniture and a fully functional TV. It’s the perfect addition if you want to decorate your home with some furniture to make it look more realistic. Most of them are used for decoration but some of them have uses too.

How to get the decorations?
All of the furniture and decorations can be crafted. We’ve listed all item IDs and crafting recipes further down on this page.

If you are in creative mode you can access the new decorations in your creative inventory.

The TV can be switched on and off by the use of redstone.
