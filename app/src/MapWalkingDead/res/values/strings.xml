        On a regular Friday, your character, Bean Milon, falls asleep on the way home.\n
        You barely see the bus hit someone, and skid off the road and crash into the woods.\n
        Three days later, you wake up all alone.\n
        No friends, no family. Theyâ€™re all dead.\n
        All your hope lies in the N.I.S.T. Facility away from the city, but it will take a lot of work to get there.\n
        Once your safe, and feel like everything is going to be alright, you find out a horrible secret.
