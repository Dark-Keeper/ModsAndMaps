        The mod adds a minimap to the game screen which can be useful to easier find your way around in Minecraft. Many different things can be changed and you can customize it to optimize for performance both on old and new devices. One of the more recent features that were introduced is mob detection. Any time mobs (e.g. cows, skeletons or zombies) are getting closer to you there will be indication blips appearing on the minimap.\n
        \n
