    <string name="main_text">The Lord of the Rings PE Mod introduces the lands of Middle-earth and its inhabitants to Minecraft Pocket Edition. Ents, warg riders and mountain trolls are just a few of the new mobs which you will come across in your future journeys. Seven new armors and loads of weapons and tools also come with the mod. It’s a great experience which offers a lot of new features to explore.\n
        \n
        Original PC Creator: Mevans\n
        \n
        Mobs\n
        Fifteen new mobs are added to the game and all of them can be found spawning randomly. It’s a mix of both friendly and hostile mobs.\n
        \n
        Ents (spawn egg ID: 511) are living trees which exist in three different variants as seen in the image below. They drop wood blocks and sticks.\n
        \n
        Mountain trolls (spawn egg ID: 520) are big creatures which are allied with the orcs. They drop troll bones and leather.\n
        \n
        Olog Hai (spawn egg ID: 519) are evil trolls which are allied with the orcs. They drop troll bones, orc steel ingots and leather.\n
        \n
        Every once in a while a legion of orcs (spawn egg ID: 530) will spawn. Besides the orcs also Olog Hais and warg riders will appear. And as you can imagine, they aren’t exactly friendly!\n
        \n
        Hobbits (spawn egg ID: 514) are like small humans living in the lands of Middle-earth. In this mod they are about the same size as yourself. They drop all kinds of delicious fruit, pies and vegetables.\n
        \n
        Wood Elves (spawn egg IDs: 518, 521, 522) are characterized by their pointed ears and can be found roaming the woods. They drop bow and arrows.\n
        \n
        Warg Riders (spawn egg ID: 515) are orcs which ride armored wargs.\n
        \n
        Wargs (spawn egg ID: 513) are animals which are usually tamed by the orcs and used for riding. They drop warg fur and warg bones.\n
        \n
        Ingots, Ores and Blocks\n
        All of the new ores can be found underground as any other ores. Ores can be used to get valuable metals which can then be used for crafting armors, tools and weapons.\n
